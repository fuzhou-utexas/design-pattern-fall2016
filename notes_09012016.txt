Iterator:
input: ++, * (read), ==, !=
output: ++, * (write)
forward: <input>, *(read/write)
bidirectional: <forward>, --
random access: <bidirectional>, +/- int, <, >, <=, >=, []

count: forward_list, list, vector, deque, set
reverse: list, vector, deque, set
sort: vector, deque

deduce what type of iterator to use
- faster reverse
- slower reverse

template <typename T>
class list {
	...
	class iterator {
		...
		using distance_type = ptrdiff_t;  // signed long
	}
}
